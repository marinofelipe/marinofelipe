### Hi there 👋

My name is Felipe, but you can also call me by my last name - Marino 🤌 .

I'm a software engineer, with expertise in development for iOS and Apple's ecosystem.<br>
I’m currently working full-time [@GetYourGuide](https://github.com/getyourguide), where our mission and journey is to share incredible experiences with travelers around the world 🗼 🎡 ⛩ 🏖 🗻.

### Open source 🔓 🌎
I love contributing to open-source, which I've been trying to do more over time.<br>
Most part of my work and contributions are written in [Swift](https://swift.org/), which is a great programming language, backed by a great community of developers that I'm proud of being part.

#### Do you like my open-source work? 🛠
I'm actively _maintaining, improving and evolving_ both:
- [CurrencyText](https://github.com/marinofelipe/CurrencyText)
- [swift-package-info](https://github.com/marinofelipe/swift-package-info/)

Contributions are more than welcome 🙏, so don't shy away of openning an issue, requesting a feature or helping me out as you can.

If any of my open-source work have helped or inpired you, has saved you time and money, please **become my sponsor** 🤝 🎁 .<br>
I'd be honored! It would help me to keep motivation, and put more resources and time to keep it going 🚀!<br>
Of course, it would also help ensuring these projects are continuously maintained and improved.

There are more great things in the oven that I plan to open-source soon 😆🤞

#### Thoughts around OSS 💭
Open-source sofware is about community, sharing, helping and being helped, therefore my goal is to sponsor some of the great contributors of our community, and increase my participation in other projects.<br>
There are amazing content out there that makes our lives better each and every day that could use some help :). By us I mean, really, all of us as individuals, developers, organizations, products, etc - I wish that orgs also further embraced the open-source cause, not mainly as consumers - something we can and should fight for 👊 .

### Learning 🌱 
- At the moment mainly exploring [FRP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_reactive_programming#:~:text=Functional%20reactive%20programming%20(FRP)%20is,map%2C%20reduce%2C%20filter) and considering learning [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/) to go deeper into the functional side of things 🙃
- Playing and building projects with SwiftUI and Combine 🚜
- Developing a backend in Swift with Vapor - while absorbing what I can from other mainstream environments and languages

### More about me 🚶‍♂️
- 🏈 I like sports, and closely follow the NFL
- 🌲 I love nature, architecture and thus visiting new places around
- 🕹 I enjoy playing video-games a lot, anxiously waiting for a PS5 and/or the rumored Nintendo Switch "Pro?"
