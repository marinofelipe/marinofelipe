### Hi there 👋

My name is Felipe, but you can also call me by my last name - Marino 🤌 .

I'm a software engineer, with expertise in development for iOS and Apple's ecosystem.<br>
I’m currently working full-time [@GetYourGuide](https://github.com/getyourguide), where our mission and journey is to share incredible experiences with travelers around the world 🗼 🎡 ⛩ 🏖 🗻.

### Learning 🌱 
- At the moment mainly exploring [FRP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_reactive_programming#:~:text=Functional%20reactive%20programming%20(FRP)%20is,map%2C%20reduce%2C%20filter) and considering learning [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/) to go deeper into the functional side of things 🙃
- Playing and building projects with SwiftUI and Combine 🚜
- Developing a backend in Swift with Vapor - while absorbing what I can from other mainstream environments and languages

### More about me 🚶‍♂️
- 🏈 I like sports, and closely follow the NFL
- 🌲 I love nature, architecture and thus visiting new places around
- 🕹 I enjoy playing video-games a lot, anxiously waiting for a PS5 and/or the rumored Nintendo Switch "Pro?"
- 😄 _Pronouns_: he/him
- 📝 From time to time I find inspiration to share thoughts on my [personal blog](https://marinofelipe.github.io/)

### Open source 🔓 🌎
I love contributing to open-source, which I've been trying to do more over time.<br>
Most part of my work and contributions are written in [Swift](https://swift.org/), which is a great programming language, backed by a great community of developers that I'm proud of being part.
