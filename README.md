### Hi there 👋

My name is Felipe, but you can also call me by my last name - Marino 🤌 .
I'm a software engineer, with expertise in development for iOS and Apple's ecosystem.<br>
I’m currently working full-time [@GetYourGuide](https://github.com/getyourguide), where our mission and journey is to share incredible experiences with travelers around the world 🗼 🎡 ⛩ 🏖 🗻.

### Learning 🌱 
- At the moment focused in apps at scale, hyper modularization, tooling, build systems and compilers
- From time to time I play with [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) - goal is dive more into low(er) level and strengthen fundamentals
- I wish I was exploring more [FRP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_reactive_programming#:~:text=Functional%20reactive%20programming%20(FRP)%20is,map%2C%20reduce%2C%20filter) - considered learning [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/), but not there yet
